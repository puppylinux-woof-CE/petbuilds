.SH NAME
dictfmt \- formats a DICT protocol dictionary database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BI dictfmt "  -c5|-t|-e|-f|-h|-j|-p [options]  basename"
.BI dictfmt "  -i|-I [options]"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dictfmt
takes a file, 
.I FILE,
on stdin, and creates a dictionary database named 
.I basename.dict,
that conforms to the DICT protocol.  It also creates an index file named 
.I basename.index.  
By default, the index is sorted according to the
C locale, and only alphanumeric characters and spaces are used in
sorting, however this may be changed with the
--locale and --allchars
options.  (
.IR basename  " is commonly chosen to correspond to the basename of"
.I FILE
, but this is not mandatory.)  

Unless the database is extremely small, it is
highly recommended that 
.I basename.dict
be compressed with
.I /usr/bin/dictzip 
to create 
.I basename.dict.dz.
(dictzip is included in
the 
.B dictd 
source package.)    

FILE may be in any of the several formats described by 
the format options \-c5, \-t, \-e, \-f, \-h, \-j, \-p, \-i or \-I.
Exactly one of 
these options must be given.

.B dictfmt
prepends several headers are to the .dict file.  The 00-database-url
header gives the value of the -u option as the URL of the site from
which the original database was obtained.  The 00-database-short
header gives the value of the -s option as the short name of the
dictionary.  (This "short name" is the identifying name given by the
"dict- D" option.)  If the -u and/or -s options are omitted, these
values will be shown as "unknown", which is undesirable for a publicly
distributed database.

The date of conversion (formatting) is given in the 00-database-info
header.  All text in the input file prior to the first headword (as
defined by the appropriate formatting option) is appended to this
header.  All text in the input file following a headword, up to the
next headword, is copied unchanged to the .dict file.

.SH FORMATTING OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c5 
.I
FILE 
is formatted with 
.B headwords 
preceded by 5 or more underscore characters (_) and a blank line. 
All text until the next 
.B headword 
is considered the definition.  Any leading `@'
characters are stripped out, but the file is otherwise unchanged. This
option was written to format the CIA WORLD FACTBOOK 1995.
.TP
.BI \-t
\-c5, \-\-without\-info and \-\-without\-headword options are implied.
Use this option, if an input database comes from
.I dictunformat
utility.
.TP
.BI \-e 
.I
FILE 
is in html format, with the 
.B headword 
tagged as bold.  (<B>headword - </B>)
.RS
This option was written to format EASTON'S 1897 BIBLE DICTIONARY.  A
typical entry from Easton is:

<A NAME="T0000005">
.br
<B>Abagtha - </B>
.br
one of the seven eunuchs in Ahasuerus's court (Esther 1:10;
2:21).

This is converted to:
.br
Abagtha
.br
   one of the seven eunuchs in Ahasuerus's court (Esther 1:10;
2:21).

The heading "<A NAME="T0000005"> is omitted, and the 
.B headword 
`Abagtha' is indexed.

.B NOTE: 
This option should be used with caution.  It removes several html tags
(enough to format Easton properly), but not all.  The Makefile that
was originally written to format dict-easton uses sed scripts to
modify certain cross reference tags.  It may be necessary to pipe the
input file through a sed script, or hack the source of dictfmt in
order to properly format other html databases.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-f 
.I FILE 
is formatted with the 
.B headwords
starting in column 0, with the definition indented at least one space
(or tab character) on subsequent lines.  
.B The third line starting in column 0 is taken as the first headword
, and the first two lines
starting in column 0 are treated as part of the 00-database-info
header.  This option was written to format the F.O.L.D.O.C.
.TP
.BI \-h 
.I
FILE 
is formatted with the 
.B headwords
starting in column 0, followed by a comma, with the definition
continuing on the same line.  All text before the first single
character line is included in 00-database-info header, and lines with
only one character are omitted from the .dict file.  
.B The first headword is on the line following the first single character line.
The 
.B headword 
is indexed; the text of the file is not changed.  This option was
written to format HITCHCOCK'S BIBLE NAMES DICTIONARY.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-j 
.I
FILE 
is formatted with 
.B headwords 
starting in col 0, enclosed in colons, followed by the definition.
The colons surrounding the 
.B headword
are removed, and the
.B headword
is indexed.  Lines beginning with '*', '=', or '-' are also removed.
All text before the first headword is included in the headers. 
This option was written to format the JARGON FILE.  
.RS
.B NOTE:
Some recent versions of the JARGON FILE had three blanks inserted
before the first colon at each headword.  These must be removed before
processing with dictfmt.  (sed scripts have been used for this
purpose. ed, awk, or perl scripts are also possible.)
.RE
.TP
.BI \-p 
.I
FILE 
is formatted with `%h' in column 0, followed by a blank, followed by the 
.B headword,
optionally followed by a line containing `%d' in column 0.  The
definition starts on the following line.  The first line beginning
\'%h\' and any lines beginning '%d' are stripped from the .dict
file, and '%h ' is stripped from in front of the headword.  All
text before the first headword is included in the headers.
.B The second line beginning '%h' is taken as the first headword.  
..br
This option was written to format Jay Kominek's elements database.  
.TP
.BI \-i \  \-I
These two options are different from all other formatting options.
They are intended to resort (according to 
.I dictd
requirement) an .index file given on stdin.
That is .dict file is not generated at all. Only resorting is made.
Three- or four-column .index like input is expected.
.B \-i
expects decimal offset and length, while
.B \-I
expects them
in base64 format.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-u " url"
Specifies the URL of the site from which the raw database was obtained.
If this option is specified, 00-database-url headword and
appropriate definition will be ignored.
.TP
.BI \-s " name"
Specifies the name and, optionally, the version and date, of the
database.  (If this contains spaces, it must be quoted.)
If this option is specified, 00-database-short headword and
appropriate definition will be ignored.
.TP
.BI \-L 
display license and copyright information
.TP
.BI \-V 
display version information
.TP
.BI \-D 
output debugging information
.TP
.BI \--help
display a help message
.TP
.BI \--locale " locale"
Specifies the locale used for sorting.  If no locale is specified, the
"C" locale is used. For using UTF-8 mode, --utf8 is needed.
.TP
.BI \--8bit
generates database in 8-bit mode, see
.I \--locale
option also.
.RS
.B Note:
This option is deprecated.
Use it for creating 8-bit (non-UTF8) dictionaries only.
In order to create UTF-8 dictionary, use
.I \--utf8
option instead.
.RE
.TP
.BI \--utf8
If specified, UTF-8 database is created.
.TP
.BI \--allchars
Specifies that all characters should be used for the search,
by default only alphabetic, numeric
characters and spaces are put to .index file and therefore
are used in search. Creates the special entry 00-database-allchars.
.TP
.BI \--case-sensitive
makes the search case sensitive.
Creates the special entry 00-database-case-sensitive.
.TP
.BI \--headword-separator " sep"
sets the headword separator, which allows several words to have the same
definition.  For example, if \'--headword-separator %%%' is given,
and the input file contains \'autumn%%%fall', both 'autumn' and 'fall'
will be indexed as  headwords, with the same definition.
.TP
.BI \--index-data-separator " sep"
sets the index/data separator, which allows to set the first and fourth
columns of .index file independently. That is
the first column can be treated as an index column
(where the MATCH command searches) and the fourth column as a result column
(where the MATCH gets things to be returned),
and they (1-st and 4-th columns) are completely independant of each other.
The default value for this separator is ASCII symbol " \\034".
.TP
.BI \--break-headwords
multiple headwords will be written on separate lines in the .dict
file.  For use with '--headword-separator.
.TP
.BI \--index-keep-headword
When \--utf-8 is specified headwords are lowercased and
non-alphanumeric characters are removed from it
before saving to .index file
in order to simplify the search.
When \--index-keep-headword option is used
fourth column is created (if necessary) in .index file,
and contains an original headword which is returned by MATCH command.
This option may be useful to prevent converting " AT&T" to " ATT"
or to keep proper nouns with uppercased first letter.
.TP
.BI \--without-headword
headwords will not be included in .dict file
.TP
.BI \--without-header
header will not be copied to DB info entry
.TP
.BI \--without-url
URL will not be copied to DB info entry
.TP
.BI \--without-time
time of creation will not be copied to DB info entry
.TP
.BI \--without-ver
By default
.B dictfmt
creates a special entry 00-database-dictfmt-X.Y.Z that contains
(in .dict file)
dictfmt version in format dictfmt-X.Y.Z. This option suppresses this.
.TP
.BI \--without-info
DB info entry will not be created.
This may be useful if 00-database-info headword
is expected from stdin (dictunformat outputs it).
.TP
.BI \-\-columns " columns"
By default
.BI dictfmt
wraps strings read from stdin to 72 columns.
This option changes this default. If it is set to zero or negative value,
wrapping is off.
.TP
.BI \-\-default\-strategy " strategy"
Sets the default search strategy for the database.
It will be used instead of strategy '.'.
Special entry
.I 00\-database\-default\-strategy
is created
for this purpose.
This option may be useful, for example,
for dictionaries containing mainly phrases but the single words.
In any case, use this option
if you are absolutely sure what you are doing.
.TP
.BI \-\-mime\-header " mime_header"
When client sends
.I OPTION MIME
command to the
.I dictd
, definitions found in this database
are prepended by the specified MIME header. Creates the special entry
00-database-mime-header.
