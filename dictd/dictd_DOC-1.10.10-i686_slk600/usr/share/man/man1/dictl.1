.TH DICTL 1
.SH NAME 
dictl \- wrapper script for 
.I dict 
that permits using 
.B utf-8 
encoded dictionaries on a terminal that is not 
.B utf-8 
aware. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dictl
.I [OPTIONS] [word]
.SH Description
.B dictl 
calls 
.I dict 
with the arguments
given on the command line.  
.B dictl 
takes the value of the environment variable
.B DICTL_CHARSET
as the user's preferred character set.  If this variable is empty, dictl
attempts to determine the character set to be used from the output of the
locale command.
.P
Arguments passed to dictl
including
.I word 
are converted from the user's preferred character set to server's character
set specified by
.B
DICTL_SERVER_CHARSET
variable
(utf-8 if it is unset),
and
passed to 
.IR dict .
The server's output from 
.I dict 
is converted to the user's preferred character set.
.P
.B NOTE:
Because
.B
iconv
omits characters from output that are invalid,
.br
.B
recode -f
is used for character set conversions by default.
If you prefer
.B iconv,
set
.B DICTL_USE_ICONV
variable to non-empty string.
If you want to use
.B
konwert,
set
.B DICTL_USE_KONWERT
to non-empty string.

Because
.I recode, iconv
and 
.I konwert
do not support conversion to or from the "C" or "POSIX" locales,
it is recommended that all users whose locale is "C" or "POSIX", set 
.B DICTL_CHARSET 
to "latin1" (ISO_8859-1).
.SH OPTIONS
dictl accepts all dict options as described in dict(1).
