ROX-Filer was created by Thomas Leonard, but many people have contributed to
it one way or another...

If you think you should be included here then write and tell me ;-)

First, a few people/projects whose work I've used:

	Andrew Clover		most of the file icons
	David MacKenzie		the code for parsing Permissions commands
	John Lindal		co-author of the XDS protocol
	Midnight Commander	the Virtual File System library & pinboard bits
	GNOME Desktop		some of the icons (including the toolbar)
	Red Hat			MIME type guessing library

A huge number of people have submitted code, suggestions and encouragement -
many of them are listed in the `Changes' file... thanks!
